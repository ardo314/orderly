# orderly

A small game to check out [The WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/). Game logic is implemented in Rust and wrapped in a wasm component. That wasm component is then used in a web frontend application build with vite.

The goal of the game is to bring the tiles into the correct order by swapping tile positions.
